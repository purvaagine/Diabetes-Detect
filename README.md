# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
The **Diabetes Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data. It uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier and is integrated into a user-friendly web interface created with **Streamlit**.

---

## Features
* **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Reads data from a CSV file.
  - Separates features (`X`) and target variable (`Y`).
  - Standardizes features using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform scaling.

* **Model Training:**
  - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trains an **SVM classifier** with a linear kernel.
  - Evaluates model accuracy on both training and testing sets.

* **Prediction and Integration:**
  - Accepts user input for medical and lifestyle attributes.
  - Predicts diabetes status based on input.
  - Saves the trained model using `pickle` for future use.
  - Provides a simple web interface for input and output using **Streamlit**.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset that includes the following features:
* **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant.
* **Glucose Level:** Plasma glucose concentration after eating.
* **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
* **Skin Thickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
* **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
* **BMI:** Body Mass Index (weight in kg/height in m²).
* **Diabetes Pedigree Function:** Likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
* **Age:** Age of the individual.
* **Outcome (Target):** 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic.

---

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:**
  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data transformation.
  - **Pandas:** For data loading and preprocessing.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For model building, feature scaling, and evaluation.
  - **Streamlit:** For building the web interface.
  - **Pickle:** For saving and loading the trained model.

---

## Process Flow
1. **Data Preparation:** Load the dataset and preprocess the features.
2. **Model Training:** Train an **SVM classifier** and evaluate its performance.
3. **Model Deployment:** Save the trained model using `pickle`.
4. **Web Interface:** Build a **Streamlit** application to accept user input, predict diabetes status, and display results.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:
 ```bash
streamlit run app.py
